# GameAuth

## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
#   The client, The Gaming Room, wanted to expand their existing Android-based game, Draw It or Lose It, into a web-based, cross-platform environment.
#   The goal was to design software that could support multiple operating platforms while maintaining a consistent user experience.
#   The application needed to manage users, teams, and game sessions efficiently, ensuring only one instance of a game could exist in memory at a time.

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
#    I did particularly well in clearly outlining the architecture and applying design patterns such as the Singleton Pattern for the GameService class.
#    I also documented the system structure and relationships between components effectively,
#    making the design easier for both technical and non-technical team members to understand.


## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
#    Working through the design document helped me organize my ideas before writing any code.
#    It forced me to think critically about scalability, data handling, and user management.
#    Creating UML diagrams and identifying patterns in advance made the development process smoother and reduced potential errors later on.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
#    If I could revise one part, I would improve the nonfunctional requirements section. I would add more detail about performance expectations,
#    testing strategies, and scalability options in cloud environments. This would make the design more robust and forward-looking.


## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
#    I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on accessibility, responsiveness, and multi-platform support.
#    The Gaming Room wanted a solution that could handle multiple concurrent users without compromising performance. 
#    Considering user needs is essential because software must solve real problems and provide a smooth, intuitive experience to succeed.


## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
#    I approached the software design using structured, object-oriented principles and iterative analysis.
#    I started with requirements gathering, then created UML class diagrams and considered appropriate design patterns.
#    In the future, I plan to use more agile design methods, integrating user feedback earlier and leveraging cloud-based architecture for scalability and flexibility.
